# # Web Scraping and Data Processing with Puppeteer

This project demonstrates web scraping and data processing using Puppeteer, a Node library that provides a high-level API to control headless browsers.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to scrape data from the [creepjs](https://abrahamjuliot.github.io/creepjs/) website, extract specific information, and save it in JSON and PDF formats. The script is designed to repeat the scraping process three times, generating a total of six files.

## Requirements

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
